## Resumo

In this guide you will find useful information on how to take advantage of Terraform to help spread good Infrastructure as Code across different organizations, hopefully, all around the globe!

## Estrutura do Conte√∫do

Every page has a few common elements, this helps you find useful information faster, no need to understand ever-changing structures when you have these resources:&#x20;

* Title - Few words focus point for the page/section
* Page Description - One line summary for the page/section
* Overview - One paragraph summary for the page/section
* Table of Contents - Structured link list to specific titles inside the page

Also there will not be more than two header levels inside each page and no more than two levels in each section, no need for excessive complexity.

## Capas das Sess√µes

Every section of this guide has a different cover image, all of them are nature related, this is a quite obvious joke on Terraform's name and the concept behind it, but it is also good for you, [there are many articles on this theme](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=looking+at+pictures+of+nature).

All these images have to be stored somewhere, and in this case it is a GitHub repository, to keep it light without loosing the concept, every subpage inside a section uses the same image as the section's main page.

As for the source of these images, they all come from a royalty free image stock called [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com), and if you believe any of them hurt copyrights of any kind, there was no intention, they are not owned by the author of these pages and there's no financial gain in their usage, so feel free to contact us and request removal of any images you own, all we need is proof and it will be removed as soon as possible.

## Linguagem

This guide is writen in English to help it achieve the largest number of people out there, maybe in the future there will be a way to make this guide available in as many languages as we are able to translate it to.
