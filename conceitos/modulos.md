## Resumo

Modules are a high level structure, they are usually isolated from other configurations, and can be used as a way to enforce policies, security and to group resources that need to be deployed together in a single abstraction.

You can generate a repository with a basic structure using this [link](https://github.com/OLeonardoRodrigues/terraform-template-lro/generate).
